By specifing the name of stock when adding data into backtrader agent, we can

- track order with `order.data._name`

- check position by `pos = self.getposition(d).size`, where `d in self.datas`

```python
brackets = self.buy_bracket(limitprice=14.00, price=13.50, stopprice=13.00)
```

set up td-ameritrade developer acct, creat apps and get API-key

Then we need to first authentication on it with 

## First Authenticated Request

To authenticate a user, we use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow described in section 1.3.1 of RFC 6749. The best way to see this in action is to follow the steps on the [**Simple Auth for Local Apps**](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/content/simple-auth-local-apps) Guide

1. Invoke the authentication window in the browser with the URL https://auth.tdameritrade.com/auth?response_type=code&redirect_uri=`{Callback URL}`&client_id=`{Consumer Key}`@AMER.OAUTHAP
2. When the user has authenticated, a GET request will be made to your redirect URI with the authorization code passed as a parameter.
3. This authorization code, once URL decoded, can then be passed as the code parameter to the Authentication API's [Post Access Token method](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/authentication/apis/post/token-0) using the ‘authorization_code’ grant type. To receive a refresh token which allows you to receive a new access token after the access token's expiration of 30 minutes, set the access type to ‘offline’.  Here is an example of a request to generate your first set of tokens:
   1. grant_type: authorization_code
      refresh_token: <null>
      access_type: offline
      code: {URL Decoded Auth Code}
      client_id: {Consumer Key}
      redirect_uri: {Callback URL}

I noticed in return page there was a code supplied so I tried it and it worked. So anyone running into this problem, just ignore the local host connection refused error.

Now go to [https://www.urldecoder.org/](https://www.urldecoder.org/) (or just google for a URL Decoder... DECODER not encoder this time)

**18.** Paste that long string of gobbledygook (everything you saved after the "code=" part) into the DECODER and click DECODE. Copy the result and save that to notepad. This is your Refresh Token
